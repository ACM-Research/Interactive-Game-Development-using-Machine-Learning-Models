## Introduction
Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly popular in the field of human-computer interaction. With this in mind, participants will program their own version of the web-based video game "Slither.io" but controlled using hand gestures through a computer webcam, rather than a keyboard like the original game. To achieve this, they will design and train a deep neural network that translates the position of the gamer's hand into game controls.
